                    you provide. By and large, they are after entertainment, be it in the form of satisfying gameplay, compelling narrative or vibrant personalities. Interactivity is also a must; viewers like being able to react live with 
                    their streamers or other fans and build social proof for community building. Many viewers continue to crave authentic, relatable content they see themselves in. Another reason is escapism, as a lot of people visit streams 
                    to relax and get away from everyday troubles for a while.</p>

                    continue to inspire streamers to create and not languish in fear of losing their viewers.</p>
